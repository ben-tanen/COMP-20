### Lab #5: Karakoke

#### By Ben Tanen

This lab involves annotating a HTML5 video using Javascript and media events.

In this case, a JS function was called whenever the video time changed (using `addEventListner()`) that checked if it should update the contents of the annotation. The contents was determined using two arrays, an array of when the lyrics should appear and an array of the lyrics themselves.

Currently, the project works in all the ways it is suppose to (lyrics appear when they should). It also shows an entire stanza until clearing it when a new stanza starts.
