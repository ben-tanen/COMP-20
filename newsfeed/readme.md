### Lab #7: Newsfeed

The purpose of this lab was to become more familiar with jQuery and to make a newsfeed using it. This was completely successful, as can be seen on the page. When a user inputs a message and presses enter, the message is added to the news feed (at the top of the feed) and also added to local storage. When the user comes back to the page, all of the previously entered items are available on the feed.

The only minor changes made to the document, other than the `<script>` that was edited, the inner text of the news div was deleted (no more "News..."). By deleting it, the "News..." no longer trails the feed.

This lab was written completely by Ben Tanen with minor documentation help from Mozilla.

This lab took approximately 15-minutes
