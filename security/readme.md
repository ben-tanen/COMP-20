### Security Report

This assignment was a report on the security of another partner's (Simon Warchol) assignment #2 and #3. Details about the report can be seen in the actual report (`index.html`).

In order to complete the task, I collaborated with Simon to view his code and discuss possible vulnerabilities. His code can be found in his private GH repo.

The research (attempting to find issues) took approximately 30-minutes and the report took approximately an hour to write.
