### Lab `#4: Responsive CSS

#### By Ben Tanen

The whole purpose of this lab was to work with responsive CSS and media queries. A successful lab will show the different squares of the homer comic (full comic, top left, top right, bottom left, bottom right) as the window size changes.

As of 9/29/14, the lab was successfully completed (you could scroll and see all interations of the comic). It took about 10 minutes to write and test the lab. It's written using CSS media queries (which can be seen in the `responsive.css` file).
